                equipment, such as harnesses, guardrails, safety nets or fall

                also use correct lifting techniques, such as bending your knees,
                keeping your back straight and holding the load close to your

                hearing protection, such as ear plugs or ear muffs, whenever the
                noise level exceeds 85 decibels. You must also limit your
